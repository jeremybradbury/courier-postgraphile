# Prerequisites

1. install docker
1. install docker-compose
1. install git
1. install node 16 (14 also works, not fully tested in 10 or 12)
1. clone repository: `git clone git@github.com:jeremybradbury/courier-postgraphile.git`

# Getting Started

1. dependencies: `npm i`
1. setup: `yarn setup` or `yarn setup_win` respectively
1. test: `yarn test` (concurrently runs `yarn start` & `yarn tests`)
1. develop: `yarn dev`
1. build schema: `yarn build`
1. "prod mode": `yarn prod` - TODO: improve this
1. ci testing: `yarn tests` (expects server is running on localhost:5000)

# Core concepts & tenets

This is a project, but also a simple base. Fork or even degit to private, just please, understand and repect the basics of [the MIT license](LICENSE.txt). Just leave it there without modification. It's a short read we often ignore.

I had to recover (in order to even fork) a common, open source repo, because the maintainer felt taken advadtange of by commerical organizations, they force-push-to-master-history-delted their repo.

Not only is licencse enforcement hard for open source maintianers, many commercial organizations fail to donate to open source projects they rely on.

Not asking for dontations (yet anyway), just a small note on where you got this project, that few will read, and even fewer will search our names when they do.

## Naming Conventions

This is pretty simple, yet requires some explaination.

1. Jest looks in the `__tests__` folders look for files of the same name.
1. GraphQL filenames match their query names.
1. DeleteObject, CreateObject and GetObjectById are relied on by test helpers.

## Integration Testing over Unit Testing

Since integration tests are actually pretty simple to automate these days, they can prevent server code from being plauged with more complex patterns to support unit testing.

This framework focuses less on commit hooks preventing bad commits, and more CI based, pre-deployment testing that can be triggered locally with ease.

## Boilerplate Testing Framework

The best way to explain something is to just show you, look at the code, run the tests quickly on your local with a Docker & PostgreSQL running on port 5435 so it shouldn't conlict with any local services, making it zero-config even if you already run ports 5432/5433/5434.

Most of my test files are just over 100 lines, including `test_helpers.js` and the 2 most complex tests: `mutation/__tests__/CreateMessage.js` & `mutation/__tests__/CreateThread.js`.

The query tests are under 10 lines & `CreateSession` is just over 10 lines.

This project is rather simple with a narrow focus, but should be able to fork and refactor for other uses.

## Difference between Unit & Integration Testing

You're probably asking, why on earth are those 2 tests files over 100 lines?

First, we start with faker to generate realistic data, rather than complex mocks. Then we actually create a record, read the record, edit the record, read the record again, delete the record, and perhaps ensure it's gone.

This allows us to test the application exactly as users intend, in all of the proper ways & contexts: local, sandbox, staging & production.

So this is why `CreateThread` & `CreateMessage` are long, we perform realtime data mocks and cleanup after.

## Why JS, not TS? - My opinions often change with new info

This is a great question, to which I have a few great answers, that you may entirely disagree with. GraphQL has consistant server & client libraries in every language maintained by different humans. The opposite approach (decentalized support, over singular) as gRPC & protobuf, to accomplish the same things: stronger typing than JSON, but not as painful as XML.

1. GraphQL gives consistant controllable typings across client & server enviornemnts.
1. TypeScript rules in the client, but server side you only need types translated/enforced properly for the database engine.
1. PostGraphile solves things much different than Prisma or NestJS, types flow from PostgreSQL to GraphQL to Apollo Client & back.
1. I want to support Node 12, Postgres 9 & use fewer dependancies.
1. Simpler is better - few lines are needed for tests & types are handled transparently.

I def suggest TypeScript with Svelte/React/etc on the client, but until we can `TSON.serialize()` & `TSON.unserialize()` on both the client & server, TS fails us at interoperability & has lead to solutions (in combination with NoSQL engines) like Kefka, SQS, GraphQL & gRPC (to replace SOAP/RPC essentially).

## What else? - Final thoughts

You may notice since we have such a long "Create" test and it also deletes & edits, you won't find edit tests or delete tests... how do even unit test a delete? The answer is vary carefully. For us it's much easier to use delete actions to cleanup our test data.

Locally, we can wipe tables and ensure nothing is left behind and we handle bugs before push it a feature branch for sandbox deployment which likely has a collection of bad data that's either synced from prod, generated and/or wiped regularly.

I believe it's best to have an archetecture that scales while getting out of the way of the developers. Fast prototpying, production ready, without upper limits is the dream.

## What's missing? - TODOs, goals, considerations & ideas

- **Add subscriptions to threads**.
- The callback nature of some helpers isn't ideal but we keep it limited to one.
- More Linux / Mac testing / testers - I work from windows for gaming reasons.
- Perhaps repeating the previous line, more prod testing.
- Client work... I only have clients in progress for Redis
- A cleaner repo, sans examples, up/down stream from this repo?
- Remove the (offically deprecated) `postgraphilerc.js` approach and use a middleware approach instead.
